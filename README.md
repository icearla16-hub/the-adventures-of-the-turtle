# The Adventures of the Turtle
___What was that noise?___

_You whip your head around, anxiously scanning the trees for whomever just snapped that twig. You quickly weigh your options: make a run for it, pick a fight, or freeze until the threat reveals itself—_

_—as a bunny. It's casually chewing on a piece of grass, looking so unbothered that you almost feel like it's mocking you. With a sigh of relief, you pick up your pace once more._

You're on the run after stealing the local dictatorship's crown jewels. As the guards close in behind you, there's only one thing standing between you and freedom: the infamous forest surrounding the kingdom. Make it through, and you're home free—the jewels are enough to pay your debts and establish the life of your dreams. Get caught, however, and the rest of your days become a nightmare. With only your wits to guide you, what will your fate be?

## What is our project about?
Our project is a choose-your-own-adventure personality test. Users face situations within the storyline, and their decisions inform the path they take through the forest, culminating in a unique ending that reveals something about their personality.

## Function Descriptions
Functions will cover three major domains: making the Tkinter display, reading and displaying text from separate files, and interpreting user inputs to shape their ending.

### 1. Making the Tkinter display
NOTE: see Lab 7 for reference
Establish a class `Display` with the following methods):
- \_\_init\_\_(): Creates a Tkinter window. Calls the following methods.
- init_window(): Initializes window. Accounts for window name, screen size, and frame sizes.
- create_turtle_frame(): Adds frame that holds a canvas with a Turtle.
- create_interface_frame(): Adds frame with buttons for user to interact with. Calls functions that will read and display text (questions and answer options).
 
### 2. Reading and displaying text from separate files
NOTE: see Homework 3 for reference
Use .csv or .txt files; one file for questions, one for answer options. The answer options will likely be formatted as follows:

    OPTION, a  
    OPTION, b  
    OPTION, c  

to allow for easy tallying of the user's responses. If the user chooses mostly a's, they receive end result A, and so on (see below).

- A - Despite the possibility of being harmed, you always choose to help.
- B - You are a practical person who chooses to help when it does not hurt you, but you won't go out of your way to help.
- C - You are a focused person, reliant on only your skills to reach your goals.

This will require the following functions:
- Read the questions file. Display questions one-at-a-time when prompted.
- Read the answer options file. Display answer options either on or above buttons in the interface frame, but do not indicate a, b, or c (those are just for our organization).
- Add user responses to a .csv or list. Loop through and find the mode, which will determine the final outcome.
- Display the user's final outcome.

## Group Members + Github Usernames

Akhila: icearla16-hub, Nora: noralz2, Andrea: andrealo2432

## How our work is going to be split

  Each person will complete three functions. We will be working on it together in person.
  - Nora: The turtle, and how it is able to move around, incorporating user input.
  - Akhila: Based on the user input (ie. which object they choose), they turn a specific direction; In addition, the question asked for the person to decide which object they would like to choose (a text file).
  - Andrea: Visuals, math/tally of each of the chosen objects

#### How we are communicating: 
We have a group chat with each other to communicate with each other, and we would do weekly checkups.
